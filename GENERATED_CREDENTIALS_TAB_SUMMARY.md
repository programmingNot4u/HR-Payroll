# Generated Credentials Tab - Employee Details

## Issue

After creating an employee, HR had no way to view the generated credentials (Employee ID, Email, Password) later. The credentials were only shown in a temporary modal during creation, making it impossible to retrieve them for existing employees.

## Solution

Added a new "Generated Credentials" tab to the Employee Details page that displays all login credentials for HR to view and share with employees.

## Changes Made

### ✅ **Added Generated Tab**

- Added "Generated Credentials" tab to the tabs array in Employee Details
- Positioned as the last tab after "Nominee Information"

A comprehensive component that displays:

#### **1. Employee ID Display**

- Shows the auto-generated Employee ID (e.g., EMP004)
- Copy button for easy sharing
- Monospace font for better readability

#### **2. Email Address Display**

- Shows the generated email address
- Copy button for easy sharing
- Handles long email addresses with proper wrapping

#### **3. Password/Login Instructions Display**

- Shows password or login instructions based on employee type
- Show/Hide toggle for password visibility (for HR users)
- Copy button for easy sharing
- Handles both password-based and phone-based login systems

#### **4. Copy All Credentials Button**

- Single button to copy all credentials at once
- Formatted text with all login information
- Gradient styling for visual appeal

#### **5. Security Instructions**

- Yellow warning box with important instructions
- Explains how to share credentials securely
- Provides login instructions for employees
- Emphasizes confidentiality
